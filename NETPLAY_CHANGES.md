# Network chnages

Read [Readme](README.md) first and ensure the mod is installed

This will list hopefully exhaustively what are the changes made by the mod.
Those change where made for balances purposes.

## Pause ? what is that ?

There is no pause on netplay. Die

## Synchronization

Most of the stuff are synchronized but some are per player while other are fully sychronized

For example buying something from the shady guy is locally simulated meaning he won't flee when you buy somehing for the others

Charging shrines are instead fully synchronized meaning every one will get the bonus.

> [!NOTE]  
> There is a bug where you can miss either your level up or your shrine upgrade because both can't happen at the same time. Will try to fix later

Magnet (Shrine and pickup) make the xp goes to a random player (No the one that interacted won't get all the xp)

You get i-frames when leveling up/getting a reward/openning a chest. This is to counter balance the fact that the game won't be paused anymore. 5 sec for choosing a reward and 1 second when finishing

### Encounter failsafe (Shared Experience)

With Shared Experience the game really pauses while everyone chooses, so every player has to
report back before the encounter can close. If one of those reports is lost, everybody used to
sit on `Waiting for other player(s) choices...` with no way out but killing the game.

The host now closes the encounter for everyone once it has been open for too long. The wait is
set by `EncounterFailsafeTimeoutSeconds` in `{your game path}/BepInEx/config/MegabonkTogether.cfg`,
defaults to 60 seconds, and `0` turns the failsafe off.

The host is the one holding the timer on purpose. If every client closed on its own timer they
would resume at different moments and desync instead of staying together.

### Shared clocks

Because that pause lasts a different amount of time for each player, the run, stage, final swarm,
difficulty and crypt clocks used to drift apart over a run. One player could be at 00:00 with the
final swarm running while another still had minutes left.

The host now broadcasts its own clocks once per second and the other players follow them whenever
they are off by more than a small tolerance. Enemy spawning and swarm events already come from the
host, so this only makes the clients agree with what the host is driving anyway.

Set `SynchronizeTimers` to `false` in the config to keep the old per player clocks.

## Disabled Save/Steam interaction

The game naturally save progression and update your achievement. The game is not really meant to be played online so all of the save/steam interaction is prohibited when playing a netplay game.
Same thing with uploading your score to the leaderbord, you would get banned anyway , so let's not do that 😅

## Custom game balance

The mod feature some game code to try to re balance the game as more player join a session.
This is **CERTAINLY** not perfect and probably unbalanced right now and will need to be tuned as more people try and report (For any dev ,the class i'm refering is `GameBalanceService.cs`). Those are the stat being modified:

- Credit timer , The credit is a value the in game sumonner use to know how much it can spawn enemies. The more player, the more credit the summonner get

- Free Chest Spawn Rate, the more player we have in a session, the more free chest we should have on the map

- Pickup Xp : The xp you get from the pickup, since pickup are synchronized, i realized player get rapidly under level since they are sharing XP. The mod will boost a bit the reward of XP on netplay to counterbalance the fact that there are less XP. The current balance is **DOUBLE** XP for 2-4 players and **TRIPLE** XP for 5 and 6 players.

- Boss lamp charge: In the graveyard, the final boss is naturally weaker the more player with have as they can quicly charge lamp on their own. To counterbalance that, there is some additionnal time required to charge a lamp. The initial charge time when playing solo is 3, its doubled for example at 2 players and quadrupled at six players.

- Max spawnable enemies: 400 and under on a final swarm (keeping the original cap) ,500 up to 4 player and 600 for 5-6 players (untested ,you have been warned)
