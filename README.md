  - Weapons (also their updgrade)
  - Projectiles (not perfect for all)
  - Monsters (follow, target, attacks)
  - Chest
  - Shrines
  - Portal
  - Challenges
  - and probably other i forgot

## Changelog

<details>
<summary>📋 Click to view full changelog</summary>

### v5.2.0

- 🔓 **Fixed the permanent soft lock on "Waiting for other player(s) choices..."**: confirmations are now counted per player instead of collected in a set that got cleared after every encounter, so a late confirmation, or one sent by a dead player, can no longer close an encounter somebody is still choosing in
- 🛡️ **Added a host side failsafe**: if an encounter stays open too long the host closes it for everyone, so a lost packet cannot end the run. Tunable with `EncounterFailsafeTimeoutSeconds` (default 60s, 0 disables it)
- 📦 **Fixed the soft lock when opening a second chest**: the chest window kept a null open button around, which crashed the game code on the next chest
- 🧟 **Fixed enemies walking off towards nothing**: target switching crashed whenever a player was not spawned yet, already gone, or dead, and that crash made it retry every single frame for every enemy
- 🔌 **Fixed silent network death**: a player could stop sending any message for the rest of the run after an error while applying a received one
- 🔯 **Fixed shrine, pylon and boss lamp charging** crashing when you left the trigger without a matching start, for example after a level change
- 📊 **Fixed kill counts and progression drifting apart** between players over a long session
- 🚀 **Less wasted work in per enemy interpolation** when the host falls behind, which is when the frame rate used to collapse

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This version changes the network format, so every player in a session needs 5.2.0.

### v5.1.0

- 🚀 **More code optimizations one more time !**

### v5.0.0

- 🐧 **Added Proton support**: You can now play with friends on Steam using Proton/Steam Deck, with cross-play on Windows. This is also an experimental and might not work perfectly

### v4.2.2

- 🚀 **Attempt to fix FPS issues**: Less critical updates are now sent unreliably, which improves bandwidth and CPU usage
- 🔧 **Attempt to fix some desync issues (Shared Experience)**: Some packets were dropped in some scenarios. Critical interactions are now sent reliably, which should prevent desync issues

### v4.2.1

- 🛠️ **Reworked damage calculation**: Some items/projectiles were not applying damage correctly. This is now globally resolved (some items still have issues, will try to fix later)

### v4.2.0

- 🚀 **More code optimizations again !**
- 🧩 **Some items fixes**: Prevent Soul Harvester / Chaos tome triggering even when not owned

### v4.1.0

- 🚀 **More improvements to tackle FPS issues**

### v4.0.3

- 🪙 **Fixed Gold desync (Shared Experience)**: Gold sharing has been reworked. Gains are now shared across everyone, while losses are applied individually. Players who can’t afford a chest are paused until eligible players finish

### v4.0.2

- 🪙 **Attempt to fix gold desync (Shared Experience)**: Computing delta instead of raw changes

### v4.0.1

- 🔄 **Attempt to fix encounter desync (Shared Experience)**: Better handling of multiple encounters occurring at the same time. It should prevent deadlocks (though laggy players might still cause issues). This fix should at least help for now.

### v4.0.0

- ✨ **Added Shared Experience mode (Experimental!)**: Shared XP, Gold and interactions across all players. This also implies an active pause on every interaction. The original mode is still available
- 🎮 **Added 'Netplay options' button**: Now gathers all netplay related options (Shared Experience and Save progression)
- 🐛 **Fixed some boss not rendering** sometimes for some reason

### v3.0.0

- ⚡ **Added a distance throttler for enemies**: They will not update / be rendered when too far away. Same idea for projectiles (reduced opacity for far away projectiles). This should help improve FPS
- 👻 **Rebalanced Reviver** to make them less punishing early (start at low health and increase per player per death)

### v2.0.2

- 🐛 **Fixed item Ghost crashing**: This was the main reason everyone was crashing
- 🐸 **Added egg interaction support**
- 🎯 **Fixed client side Challenge shrines interactions** not working properly

### v2.0.1

- 💾 **Added option** to allow saving in netplay sessions. Use at your own risk
- 📦 **Properly queue encounter rewards** to prevent missing rewards when multiple encounters happen simultaneously. This should also fix random crash hopefully
- 📊 **Properly track kills/money** per player
- 🔌 **Fixed disconnection issues** preventing reconnection
- 🎮 **Fixed button selection reset issue** in character window
- 🎯 **Fixed projectile not despawning** in singleplayer mode
- 🔗 **Fixed some connection issues** in relay mode for some users

### v2.0.0

- 🎉 **Added changelog system**: See what's new after each update!
- 🎮 **Implemented Friendlies**: A private queue system. One host share a code and other join with it.
- ⚰️ **Added a new interactable, Reviver**: When a player die, it will now spawn a Coffin. Other player have to defeat his ghost to respawn the dead player

### v1.3.0

- 🛒 **Thunderstore support**: No auto update for thunderstore as they have to update throught the website or r2modman
- ⚖️ **Balance change**: Reduced Credits earning to limit a bit spawned enemies

### v1.2.0

- 📊 **Add latency indicator to the host**: The host see latency for all clients

### v1.1.0

- 🔄 **Generate updater on the fly**

### v1.0.0

- 🚀 **Initial release !** Thanks for trying the mod

# Install

This mod is developed and tested on Windows. Linux is supported through **Proton** (see [Linux Support](#linux-support-proton--steam-deck)), including cross-play with Windows players. The **native** Linux build of the game does not work and cannot be made to work from this mod, see the section below for why. macOS is untested.

Also this mod was developed for the 1.0.49 version (ok let me rant a bit, it was developed on previous update but Graveyard update broke some major stuff, i was a bit mad but its okay now, i fixed all the stuff), meaning it will probably break when an official major update drop .

> [!NOTE]  
> Before starting, i suggest to make a backup of your current save file just in case.
> The game save is somewhere at `{user}/AppData/LocalLow/Ved/Megabonk/Saves/CloudDir/{some steam id guess}`

> You can also just copy all at `{user}/AppData/LocalLow/Ved/Megabonk` if not sure

> Make sure to copy your save somewhere in case you need to restore it back for some reason

This mod run with [BepInEX 6 Bleeding Edge Build](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) (tested on the current latest #752):

Start by downloading the BepInex loader [BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.752](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be/752/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.752%2Bdd0655f.zip) in your game directory (Where your Megabonk.exe is). This mean you want to extract BepInEx at something like `{your own path}\steamapps\common\Megabonk`

> [!NOTE]  
> We specifically target the IL2CPP version (.IL2CPP) in the BepInEx build page and also the windows (-win) and the 64 bits (-x64) version of BepInex.

> Not sure if i will upgrade this page every new BepInEx update this how you know what version you should get

> Also i dont know if 64 bits is tied with how the game was built or your system , if the 64 bits version is not working, i guess you should try the 32 bits (x86) version (something like `BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x86-6.0.0-be`)

- Launch the game first at least one time to confirm BepInEx is working (Wait for the main menu as BepInEx need to make some dummy dll). Yous should see a terminal opened along side with the game with some logs in it

- After exiting the game,grab and download the [latest release](https://github.com/Fcornaire/megabonk-together/releases/latest)

- Extract the zip and copy the folder `Megabonk-Together` to the plugins path of BepInEx , something like `../steamapps/common/Megabonk/BepInEx/plugins`

- Launch the game and confirm a new weird `Togther!` button is at the bottom of the main screen

> [!NOTE]  
> The button is not navigable right now, you won't be able to select it with a controller , use your mouse to interact with it (You can pick your controller later)
> Will try to fix later

- Enjoy ! Do not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/Fcornaire/megabonk-together/issues) if you encounter a bug or something isn't working

# How to play

## Random

Play on a random queue, the next 6 players within a time period will get matched together (no pun intended)

## Friendlies

Private queue, Host as to share the room code (copy from the uper right button) and paste it to the players he want to play with

# Self-Hosting a Server

If you want to run your own matchmaking/relay server, check the [Self-Hosting Guide](docs/Setup-Own-Server.md).

# Known issue

- For some obscure reason, The game crash when loading the map. this is mostly rare and you can just close and restart the game if it ever happen. Dunno why it sometimes crash here ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Not all the stuff happening in the game are perfectly synchronized, like getting money when you shouldn't or ghost item not spawning or whatever. I will mostly be looking for game breaking bug before looking at those
- Progression, quests and Steam achievements are not synchronized yet. Saving during netplay is off by default and can be turned on with `AllowSavesDuringNetplay`
- The graveyard final boss keeps its shield on guest clients even once all four lamps are charged
- Frame rate still drops during the late swarms with several players. Some causes are fixed in 5.2.0 but this is not solved
- Native Linux does not work, see [Linux Support](#linux-support-proton--steam-deck). Use Proton

# Building (Developer)

- Clone this repository
- Set the environment variable **MegabonkPath** pointing to your own game install (something like _../steamapps/common/Megabonk_) for your IDE to know where to get the required DLLs to load for building the mod
- Build the solution

You should now have the macthmaking server built and also the mod file

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The IDE will copy the result mod file in your game directory. This is super practical when developing locally but remember to delete it after.

To target a local server, modify the file `{your game path}/BepInEx/config/MegabonkTogether.cfg` and update [Network].ServerUrl to `ws://127.0.0.1:5000`

# Linux Support (Proton / Steam Deck)

The mod is compatible with Linux via **Proton**, which is required rather than merely recommended.

## Why native Linux does not work

The **native** Linux (ELF) build of the game is not supported, and not because of glibc or CET
conflicts as previously stated here. Il2CppInterop locates IL2CPP's internal runtime functions by
scanning for byte signatures derived from Windows PE builds. Against the ELF `GameAssembly.so`
those patterns do not match, so it falls back to substitutes and then dereferences them:

```
[Warning:Il2CppInterop] Class::Init signatures have been exhausted, using a substitute!
[Warning:Il2CppInterop] GarbageCollector::RunFinalizer not found, disabling Il2CppObjectPool
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Cpp2IL handles the ELF binary fine and all interop assemblies are generated, so the failure is not
in the preloading step. The segfault happens in the chainloader, **before MegabonkTogether is
loaded at all**, which is why no change in this mod can work around it. The blocker sits upstream in
BepInEx's Il2CppInterop.

Thanks to [@PapistProtocol](https://github.com/Fcornaire/megabonk-together/issues/97) for the analysis
and the core dump that pinned this down.

## Installation

1. **Configure Game for Proton:**
   - In Steam, right-click **Megabonk** -> **Properties** -> **Compatibility**.
   - Check "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool".
   - Select **Proton 9.0** (or Experimental).

2. **Install BepInEx 6 (Windows x64):**
   - Download the latest `BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.*` build from [BepisBuilds](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be).
   - Extract the contents directly into your game directory (`.../steamapps/common/Megabonk/`).
   - **Crucial:** You must see `winhttp.dll` next to `Megabonk.exe`.

3. **Configure Launch Options:**
   - In Steam Properties -> General -> Launch Options, add:
     ```bash
     WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%
     ```
   - _This tells Proton to load the local `winhttp.dll` (BepInEx) instead of the system one._

4. **First Run:**
   - Launch the game once to let BepInEx generate the interop assemblies. This might take a minute on the splash screen.

5. **Install the Mod:**
   - Download the latest proton [release](https://github.com/Fcornaire/megabonk-together/releases/latest) (in the release page, grab the -proton zip).
   - Extract the `Megabonk-Together` folder into `.../Megabonk/BepInEx/plugins/`.

After installation, your Megabonk directory should look like this:

```text
Megabonk/
├── BepInEx/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── interop/             <-- Generated on first run
│   ├── unity-libs/          <-- Generated on first run
│   └── plugins/
│       └── MegabonkTogether/
│           ├── MegabonkTogether.dll
│           ├── MegabonkTogether.Common.dll
│           └── (other dependency DLLs)
├── Megabonk_Data/
├── winhttp.dll
├── doorstop_config.ini
├── Megabonk.exe
├── GameAssembly.dll
└── UnityPlayer.dll
```

## Building on Linux

You can build the mod natively on Linux using the .NET 8 SDK.

- Ensure `dotnet-sdk-8.0` is installed.
- Clone the repository.
- Run the build script:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/proton/build.sh
  ```

- A `Directory.Build.props` file can be used to override the `MegabonkPath` if your game is installed elsewhere.

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <MegabonkPath>/home/user/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Megabonk</MegabonkPath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
